Movie Recommendation System
Overview
Recommendation systems are essential tools for digital platforms, helping users navigate vast amounts of content by offering personalized suggestions. By analyzing user behavior, these systems predict and display items tailored to individual preferences, enhancing user experience and driving engagement. They are crucial for companies like Netflix and Amazon, where dynamic, accurate recommendations significantly influence what users see and choose.

This project is a simple movie recommendation system that leverages collaborative filtering to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. The recommendations are served via a Flask API.

Dataset
The dataset used is the MovieLens dataset, collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. It consists of three files:

u.data
u.item
u.genre
Technologies Used
Python: NumPy, pandas
Flask: For API development
JSON: For data exchange
How to Run
1. Set Up the Environment
Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Start the Flask API
Run the application using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
3. Make API Calls Using Postman
You can test the API using Postman or any other tool that supports HTTP requests.

API Call Details
Type: POST
URL: http://localhost:5000/recommend
Body (RAW - JSON format):
json
Copy code
{
    "user_id": 100,
    "user_data": [
        { "movie_id": 1, "rating": 5 },
        { "movie_id": 2, "rating": 4 }
    ],
    "movies": [
        { "movie_id": 1, "title": "Movie A" },
        { "movie_id": 2, "title": "Movie B" },
        { "movie_id": 3, "title": "Movie C" }
    ],
    "num_recommendations": 5
}
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset files.
main.py: Main file to run the Flask API.
recommendation_model.py: Contains the recommendation logic using collaborative filtering.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.
README.md: Project documentation.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic yet functional movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering. It's a practical example of how recommendation engines work and can be extended or integrated into larger applications.
